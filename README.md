# nb-wrangler

DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT  -- subject to weekly/daily change top to bottom

## Overview
nb-wrangler streamlines the process of curating JupyterLab notebooks, their runtime environments, and ultimately supports automatically building and testing Docker images based on notebook requirements. It achieves this by:

- Bootstrapping a dedicated environment for nb-wrangler.
- Loading, saving, and validating notebook curation specifications.
- Cloning associated notebook and image build repositories.
- Creating a dedicated environment to manage notebook package dependencies.
- Compiling loose `requirements.txt` files into versioned dependencies for the target environment.
- Installing notebook dependencies in the target environment.
- Explicitly testing all top-level notebook imports in the installed environment.
- Running notebooks headless within the target environment.
- Injecting relevant package, test, and notebook output into an external notebook image build system.
- Submitting completed specifications and/or related image build pull requests to trigger automatic builds.
- Performing various cleanup tasks, such as removing clones, packages, and environments.

The project utilizes foundational tools:

- **micromamba:** A lightweight, self-contained version of mamba (a free, open-source alternative to conda).
- **uv:** A new, fast pip-like package installer written in Rust.

nb-wrangler aims to install 2-3 dedicated environments under `$HOME/.nbw-live`:

- **micromamba:** A self-contained installation tool, not a base environment.
- **nbwrangler:** A full micromamba environment containing nb-wrangler and its dependencies.
- **spec defined environment:** The notebook environment being curated.

These environments are independent of your existing Python environments and can be easily registered as notebook kernels in JupyterHub.

The location of nb-wrangler files can be changed by setting the `NBW_ROOT` environment variable. This is useful for team environments or relocating to faster storage.

## Installing

Bootstrapping the system creates the `$HOME/.nbw-live` directory and the nbwrangler environment under `$HOME`.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacetelescope/nb-wrangler/refs/heads/main/nb-wrangler >nb-wrangler
chmod +x nb-wrangler
./nb-wrangler bootstrap
source ./nb-wrangler environment
```

Afterward, the nbwrangler "curation" environment can be re-activated using:

```bash
source ./nb-wrangler environment
```

Consider adding the nb-wrangler bash script to your shell's PATH or RC file.

The target environment can be activated with:

```bash
source nb-wrangler activate ENVIRONMENT_NAME
```

Deactivate either nbwrangler or the target environment with:

```bash
source nb-wrangler deactivate
```

## Curation

The wrangler prepares a custom version of the `spec.yaml` file. Then, run:

```bash
nb-wrangler spec.yaml --curate [--verbose]
```

## Build Submission

After completing development of a spec, you can submit it to https://github.com/spacetelescope/science-platform-images
to automatically build a Docker image which becomes available for use on the relevant STScI science platforms.

```bash
gh auth login
nb-wrangler spec.yaml --submit-for-build [--verbose]
```

In addition to installing nb-wrangler, prerequisites for submitting specs for Docker builds are:

- You need your own GitHub account
- Your GitHub account needs to be granted appropriate permissions by the spaceteletscope/science-platform-images project.
- You need to install the GitHub command line interface program `gh` using `brew` on OS-X or `apt-get` or `dnf` on Linux.
- You need to authenticate with gh as shown -or- set GH_TOKEN or GITHUB_TOKEN to a token with appropriate permissions.

For more information on `gh` see [GH CLI](https://cli.github.com  "gh GitHub CLI program").

## Spec Re-install

A finished spec can be used to re-install corresponding Python environments in any nb-wrangler installation as follows:

```bash
nb-wrangler spec.yaml --reinstall
```

## Automatic Testing

For both curation and reinstallation work flows it's useful to execute tests to demonstrate that the installation is
working correctly with the specified notebooks.  To that end,  nb-wrangler has additional switches which can be added
with the following effects:

- `--test-imports`  directs nb-wrangler to import the packages found imported by the notebooks. Fast, if the import succeeds the test passes.

- `--test-notebooks`  directs nb-wrangler to execute the specified notebooks headless. If the notebook raises an exception the test fails.

- `-t` directs nb-wrangler to run both `--test-imports` and `--test-notebooks`.

For example, you can iterate fairly rapidly with:

```bash
nb-wrangler spec.yaml --curate --test-imports
```

to verify that the notebook dependencies have been accounted for on some level, then switch to `--test-notebooks` for more meaningful checks and verification that emprically viable package versions are installed.

## Basic Flow

The wrangler executes steps in a sequence, allowing for skipping steps that have already completed. This enables iteration without repeatedly recompiling and reinstalling packages. If any step fails, the process exits with an error. Most features are controlled by command-line options.

- **Spec Management:** Loads, validates, updates, and saves the YAML notebook specification. Validation is currently incomplete but checks for required keywords.
- **Repository Management:** Optionally clones Git repositories for notebooks if a local clone doesn't exist; otherwise, it updates existing clones. `--repos-dir` specifies the directory for cloning, defaulting to a `notebook-repos` subdirectory of the current directory.
- **Notebook Discovery:** Searches for notebooks based on directory paths and include/exclude patterns.
- **Requirements Gathering:** Locates `requirements.txt` files within notebooks to specify Python package version constraints.
- **Environment Creation:** Automatically creates a basic Python environment for package installation and testing.
- **Target Environment Initialization:** Optionally initializes a target environment to facilitate requirement compilation, package installation, and testing. This includes creating a JupyterLab kernel required for notebook testing or use in JupyterLab.
- **Package Compilation:** If `--compile-packages` is specified, creates both a conda environment `.yml` file and a locked pip `requirements.txt` file by compiling all discovered notebook requirements. If `--compile-packages` is not specified, it uses the last compiled package set from the specification.
- **Package Installation:** If `--install-packages` is specified, installs the compiled packages in the conda environment. After installation, it attempts to import packages listed in notebook files for basic sanity checks.
- **Notebook Testing:** If `--test-notebooks` is specified, runs notebooks matching a comma-separated list of names or regular expressions. If no notebooks or regexps are provided, it runs all notebooks. This is a headless crash test that runs up to `--jobs [n]` notebooks in parallel, with a `--timeout [seconds]` to terminate runaway notebooks.
- **Repository Cleanup:** If `--delete-repos` is specified, removes all cloned repositories.
- **Spec Reset:** If `--reset-spec` is specified, removes the output section from the `spec.yaml` file.
- **Environment Deletion:** If `--delete-env` is specified, removes the entire target environment. This dedicated environment approach prevents contamination between iterations.
- **CI Submission:** If `--submit-for-build` is specified, the specification is forwarded to the CI pipeline, key information is provided to the build framework, and a corresponding image is automatically built and pushed to the hub (pending further development).
- **Output Injection:** If `--inject-spi` is specified, extracts key output information (e.g., mamba and pip requirements, import tests, supported notebooks) from the specification and injects it into a clone of the science platform images build, enabling manual builds.

## Missing Topics

- **Detailed explanation of `spec.yaml` structure:** While mentioned, a more detailed breakdown of the YAML file's sections and their purpose would be beneficial.
- **Configuration options:** A more comprehensive list of available configuration options and their effects.
- **Error handling:** More information on how the tool handles various errors and provides feedback to the user.
- **Advanced usage:** Potential use cases beyond basic curation, such as automated testing workflows or integration with other tools.
